Model Alignment
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Introduction

NeMo-Aligner is a scalable toolkit for efficient model alignment. The toolkit has support for state of the art model alignment algorithms such as SteerLM, DPO and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). These algorithms enable users to align language models to be more safe, harmless and helpful. Users can do end-to-end model alignment on a wide range of model sizes and take advantage of all the parallelism techniques to ensure their model alignment is done in a performant and resource efficient manner. For more technical details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01481).

NeMo-Aligner toolkit is built using the [NeMo Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) which allows for scaling training up to 1000s of GPUs using tensor, data and pipeline parallelism for all components of alignment. All of our checkpoints are cross compatible with the NeMo ecosystem; allowing for inference deployment and further customization.

The toolkit is currently in its early stages, and we are committed to improving the toolkit to make it easier for developers to pick and choose different alignment algorithms to build safe, helpful and reliable models.

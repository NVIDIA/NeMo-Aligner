  # this parameter tells PyTriton what our preferred batch sizes are
  # for request batching. This parameter is distinct from
  # the model.forward_micro_batch_size to optimize for cases where Pipeline Parallelism
  # is enabled. Because in that case we will want PyTriton to give us
  # a very large batch, but then in the model we will cut it into smaller
  # batches (determined by model.forward_micro_batch_size) to fill the pipe better.
  # NOTE: this parameter can be a list as well, in that case we will give a list of preferred batch
  # sizes to PyTriton
